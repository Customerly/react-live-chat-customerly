## üöÄ How to use

To integrate Customerly Livechat to your React app, you need to have an account with Customerly. [Sign up here](https://www.customerly.io/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=README&utm_campaign=ReactSDK).

```javascript
import {CustomerlyProvider} from "react-live-chat-customerly";

ReactDOM.render(
    <CustomerlyProvider appId={"YOUR_APP_ID"}>
        <App/>
    </CustomerlyProvider>,
    document.getElementById("root")
);
```

And then, you can use the `useCustomerly` hook to load the messenger, and interact with it.

```javascript
const App: FunctionComponent = () => {
    const { load } = useCustomerly();

    useEffect(() => {
        load({ ... })
    }, []);
    
    return (
        <Things />
    )
}
```
